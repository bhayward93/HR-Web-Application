# HR-Web-Application
An interlinked solution demonstrating skills in C#, Entity Framework, Web APIs and WCF Services. 

# Instructions
Databases must be hosted locally using the files provided in /SQL. MainDB-SQL2012 , or the 2014 variant. For skills (FrontEnd), repeat the process.

# Administration System
An MVC C# Web Application, serving the administration of the HR Business Unit. Facilitates the management of 'Business Units' and 'Staff', with Create, Read, Soft Delete and Edit (C.R.U.D) functionality. Work has been done within views, however the premise of this project was not to create pretty HTML and CSS.  

# Web API Service
Using EntityFramemwork and the Database provided, provides a JSON REST, Web API to work with the database.  

# Front End
Linking Skills (WCF), Business Units and Staff together. Does not currently compile and I do intend to go back to this at some point.
